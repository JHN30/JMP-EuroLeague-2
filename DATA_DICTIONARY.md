# EuroLeague data dictionary

The current local database has 28 source-derived tables in the PostgreSQL
`silver` schema. The loader and CSV exporter use `search_path = silver`, so
a bare name such as `games` means `silver.games`. Exact SQL columns, types,
source JSON paths, and keys are defined in
[flat_schema.py](../postgres_etl/flat_schema.py). Bronze keeps the exact API
responses. Silver contains cleaned source data. The local `gold` schema holds
16 source projections from Silver, derived postseason player stats, the
page-shaped standings table, team-season totals, two coverage tables, the three
record leaderboards, postseason series, and the two identity tables. The 30f
publisher maps these 26 tables to Neon's `public.app_*` tables. The one-time
in-place Neon migration and first E2026 publish completed on 2026-09-28.

## Neon app-table contract

The 16 Gold source tables publish to `public.app_<source>`:
`app_seasons`, `app_clubs`, `app_people`, `app_registrations`, `app_rounds`,
`app_games`, `app_game_officials`, `app_game_period_scores`,
`app_game_player_stats`, `app_game_team_stats`,
`app_season_player_stats_traditional`, `app_season_player_stats_advanced`,
`app_season_player_stats_scoring`, `app_season_player_stats_misc`,
`app_play_by_play`, and `app_shots`. The ten Gold derivations retain their
`app_*` names: `app_standings`, `app_team_season_stats`,
`app_coverage_seasons`, `app_coverage_games`,
`app_records_player_seasons`, `app_records_single_games`,
`app_records_team_seasons`, `app_postseason_series`, `app_players`, and
`app_club_identities`. The 12 tables of features 26-29 (30g) and the two per-game tables
`app_game_player_advanced` and `app_game_team_advanced` (30h) the four `app_game_team_*`
per-game play-by-play tables (30i) and `app_game_player_on_court`, `app_game_team_lineup_stints` and
`app_game_stat_gaps` (30j) make 47 targets.

The three record tables and two identity tables replace all rows for the
selected competition. The other 42 tables replace one selected season. One
Neon transaction covers all selected tables. The publisher verifies exact
post-copy counts and refuses a scope below 90% of its previous row count unless
`--allow-shrink` is explicit. `app_play_by_play` and `app_shots` copy only changed
games. A failed transaction leaves previous rows visible. The read-only
`--dry-run` reports counts, schema differences, changed games, and shrink
refusals. A failed pipeline run keeps its publish-pending state for retry.

## Silver provenance

Each of the 28 source tables has `load_id UUID NOT NULL` and
`loaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL`. A table, competition, and season replacement
gives every inserted row the same load ID and UTC time. These columns are
metadata and do not change source table keys or grains.

`silver.load_log` is a separate metadata table with one append-only record per
successful table/competition/season replacement, including zero-row loads.
Its key is (`competition_code`, `season_code`, `table_name`, `load_id`). It also
contains `loaded_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL`, `row_count BIGINT NOT NULL`, and
`bronze_versions JSONB NOT NULL`. `row_count` is the number of rows inserted
by that replacement. `bronze_versions` is a sorted, deduplicated JSON array of
the exact files read, using POSIX paths relative to `data/bronze/`, for example
`euroleague/E2025/v2/games/<fetched_at>_<sha16>.json.gz`. The list can include
catalog and auxiliary resources used during transformation. A rerun retains
the old log entry, but its current rows point to the new load ID.

```sql
SELECT g.game_code, g.loaded_at, l.bronze_versions
FROM silver.games AS g
JOIN silver.load_log AS l
  ON l.competition_code = g.competition_code
 AND l.season_code = g.season_code
 AND l.table_name = 'games' AND l.load_id = g.load_id
WHERE g.competition_code = 'E' AND g.season_code = 'E2025'
LIMIT 20;
```

The feature 16b historical backfill reloaded all 27 cached EuroLeague seasons
(E2000-E2026). All 727 existing table/season scopes retained their row counts:
3,987,204 source rows in total. The initial load wrote 742 log entries,
including zero-row replacements; a controlled E2025 `games` rerun added one
more. Every current row matches its log entry, and both provenance columns
are non-null in all 28 source tables.

## Silver table names and keys

Every primary key begins with `competition_code` and `season_code`.
Filter on both: `E2025` means the 2025-26 EuroLeague season. Codes such as
`person_code` are text to preserve leading zeroes. The extra key shown below
completes the primary key.

| Table | Extra key | Source/grain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seasons` | none | One competition season from the v2 catalogue. |
| `clubs` | `club_code` | One club in one season. |
| `people` | `person_key` | One deduplicated person in one season. |
| `registrations` | `registration_key` | One person's club and role registration. |
| `rounds` | `round_key` | One phase and round definition. |
| `games` | `game_code` | One played or scheduled fixture. |
| `game_officials` | `game_code`, `official_number` | One official assigned to a game. |
| `game_period_scores` | `game_code`, `side`, `period_number` | One quarter or overtime score. |
| `game_player_stats` | `game_code`, `side`, `person_key` | One player's game box score. |
| `game_team_stats` | `game_code`, `side`, `stats_kind` | One team's box score row or total. |
| `game_stat_gaps` | `game_code`, `stat_name` | A missing or unrecorded game measure; `*` means no box score. Gold copy published as `public.app_game_stat_gaps` (30j); it has no rows from E2012 on, so it is empty for E2025 and E2026. |
| `play_by_play` | `game_code`, `period`, `event_ordinal` | One live event. |
| `shots` | `game_code`, `shot_ordinal` | One shot attempt. |
| `season_player_stats_traditional` | `phase_code`, `mode`, `entry_ordinal` | One player entry in a v3 traditional feed. |
| `season_player_stats_advanced` | same | One player entry in an advanced feed. |
| `season_player_stats_scoring` | same | One player entry in a scoring feed. |
| `season_player_stats_misc` | same | One player entry in a misc feed. |
| `season_team_stats_traditional` | `phase_code`, `mode`, `club_code` | One club in a v3 traditional feed. |
| `season_team_stats_advanced` | same | One club in an advanced feed. |
| `season_team_stats_opponents_traditional` | same | One club's opponents in a traditional feed. |
| `season_team_stats_opponents_advanced` | same | One club's opponents in an advanced feed. |
| `standings_basic` | `phase_code`, `round_number`, `club_code` | One club snapshot after a round. |
| `standings_calendar` | same | Calendar standings snapshot. |
| `standings_streaks` | same | Streak summaries. |
| `standings_ahead_behind` | same | Checkpoint ahead/behind summaries. |
| `standings_margins` | same | Margin summaries. |
| `standings_calendar_streaks` | `phase_code`, `round_number`, `club_code`, `streak_ordinal` | One calendar streak. |
| `standings_basic_form` | `phase_code`, `round_number`, `club_code`, `result_ordinal` | One recent result. |

### Derived per-game advanced tables

`game_team_advanced` (extra key `game_code`, `side`; one row per club per played
game with a full box score) and `game_player_advanced` (`game_code`, `side`,
`person_key`; one row per player box score) are computed by
`postgres_etl/advanced.py` from Silver only. They are not loaded from Bronze,
carry the same `load_id` and `loaded_at` columns. Gold projects both as
`gold.game_team_advanced` and `gold.game_player_advanced` (see below).
Ratios are fractions (0.512); NULL means a needed measure was missing or a
denominator was zero. Forfeits (`game_stat_gaps` `*`) and unplayed games have
no rows.

| Column | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| `game_minutes` | 40, plus 5 per overtime period in `game_period_scores` |
| `own_possessions_estimate` | `field_goals_attempted + 0.44 x free_throws_attempted - offensive_rebounds + turnovers` for the club |
| `possessions` | Average of both clubs' estimates, identical on both rows |
| `pace` | `40 x possessions / game_minutes` |
| `offensive_rating`, `defensive_rating`, `net_rating` | `100 x points / possessions` for the club and its opponent; net is the difference |
| `efg_pct`, `opp_efg_pct` | `(field_goals_made + 0.5 x three_pointers_made) / field_goals_attempted` |
| `tov_pct`, `opp_tov_pct` | `turnovers / (field_goals_attempted + 0.44 x free_throws_attempted + turnovers)` |
| `orb_pct`, `drb_pct` | Own rebounds of a type / (own + opponent's of the other type) |
| `ft_rate`, `opp_ft_rate` | `free_throws_made / field_goals_attempted` |
| `true_shooting_pct` | `points / (2 x (field_goals_attempted + 0.44 x free_throws_attempted))` |
| `assist_ratio` | `assists / field_goals_made` |
| `game_score` (player) | Hollinger: `points + 0.4 FGM - 0.7 FGA - 0.4 (FTA - FTM) + 0.7 OREB + 0.3 DREB + steals + 0.7 assists + 0.7 blocks - 0.4 fouls_committed - turnovers` |
| `usage_pct`, `assist_pct`, `orb_pct`, `drb_pct`, `trb_pct`, `steal_pct`, `block_pct` (player) | Basketball-Reference forms using `seconds_played` and the club's official `total` row; NULL for zero minutes. `steal_pct` uses the game's possessions, `block_pct` the opponent's two-point attempts |
| `tov_pct`, `efg_pct`, `true_shooting_pct` (player) | Same forms as the club columns, from the player's own line |

Published to Neon as `public.app_game_player_advanced` / `public.app_game_team_advanced`
(E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30h migration is applied. Build:
`python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb game_team_advanced game_player_advanced`.
The Gold tables drop `load_id` and `loaded_at`; the team table also drops
`opponent_club_code`, `phase_code` and `round_number`. Keys: `competition_code`,
`season_code`, `game_code`, `side` (plus `person_key` for players). The player table adds
`club_code`, `seconds_played` and three game PER columns:

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `game_uper` | Hollinger's unadjusted PER per minute from that game's box-score line only, with the team's assist ratio for that game and league constants (factor, VOP, DRB%) summed over every counted game of the game's phase scope (`RS`, `PI`, `PO`, `FF`, ...) through the game's round, exactly as `player_round_ratings` |
| `game_aper` | `game_uper` x league pace (same scope, through the round) / the game's own team pace |
| `game_per` | `game_aper` x 15 / the seconds-weighted mean `game_aper` of the games in the same scope and round, so the league mean is 15 per scope and round |

NULL when `seconds_played` is 0 or missing, an input is missing or a denominator is zero;
there is no minutes cutoff, so a few minutes can give an extreme value. Zero-minute rows keep
Silver's `game_score` but have NULL rates and PER. Season PER is not an average of game PER:
use `player_round_ratings` (last round of the season). A player's first game ties `player_round_ratings.per`
(scope `RS`, round 1) exactly; `--quality-only` checks the round-1 ties against the round tables
(to 0.00001, since those divide rounded sums), the league mean, row shape and null handling, and
warns where a percentage is below 0 or above 2.

These are box-score estimates. Counted play-by-play possessions sit next to them in
`game_team_possessions` (below) and never replace them.

### `game_team_possessions`

Built by `python postgres_etl/possessions.py -sc <seasons>` from `play_by_play`, `games`
and `game_team_advanced` (E2007 onward; earlier seasons have no play-by-play and no
rows). Extra key `game_code`, `side`; one row per club per played game with events and a
`game_team_advanced` row. Same provenance columns. Gold copy `gold.game_team_possessions` (without the provenance columns) is published to Neon as `public.app_game_team_possessions` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30i migration is applied.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `counted_possessions` | Possessions counted from the event stream |
| `possession_seconds` | Sum of the measurable possession lengths, in game seconds |
| `avg_possession_seconds` | `possession_seconds` / the number of possessions with a measurable length (NULL when none) |
| `estimated_possessions` | The box-score `possessions` of `game_team_advanced`, copied for comparison |

Rules. Events are ordered by period, then `event_ordinal` (which restarts each period;
`play_number` is not chronological). `marker_time` is the time left in the period, turned
into elapsed game seconds (10:00 per quarter, 5:00 per overtime; every overtime carries the
period label `ExtraTime`, the overtime number comes from `minute`). Shots are `2FGM`,
`3FGM`, `LAYUPMD` and `DUNK` (made) and `2FGA`, `3FGA`, `LAYUPATT`, `2FGAB`, `3FGAB`
(missed): E2008-E2014 record many shots as layups, dunks and blocked attempts, and with those
types the event totals equal the box score's field goals made and attempted. A possession
ends, for the team that had it, on a made field goal, a turnover, a defensive rebound after a
miss, the last made free throw of a trip, and the end of a period; an offensive rebound
continues it. A trip is consecutive free throws of one club at the same clock, ignoring
substitutions, timeouts and fouls between them; technical free throws (after a technical or
coach or bench technical event) count for nothing, and an and-one adds no possession. When
the other club acts while a club is recorded as holding the ball, the earlier club's
possession is ended at that point. Length is the elapsed time from the previous possession's
end (or the period start) to the end.

Agreement with the box-score estimate over E2007-E2026 (10,098 club games): counted minus
estimated averages +0.12 possessions (standard deviation 1.38), 90.2% of club games are within
3%, 98.3% within 5% and 99.8% within 10%; the average possession lasts 17.0 seconds. E2007-E2009
are looser (E2007 within 3%: 71%) and E2019-E2025 tighter (93-95%). Event counts match the box
score exactly for turnovers (99.4% of club games), free throws made and attempted, and (once
layups and dunks are included) field goals. `--quality-only` checks the stored rows against a
fresh derivation and prints a warning for club games whose counted possessions differ from the
estimate by more than 10% (16 rows across E2007-E2026: 7 in E2007 and 9 in E2009).

### `game_team_score_flow`

Built by `python postgres_etl/score_flow.py -sc <seasons>` from `play_by_play` and `games`
(E2007 onward; same rows as `game_team_possessions`). Extra key `game_code`, `side`; one row
per club per played game whose events carry a running score. Same provenance columns. Gold copy `gold.game_team_score_flow` (without the provenance columns) is published to Neon as `public.app_game_team_score_flow` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30i migration is applied.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `points_for`, `points_against` | Final score from the running score (equal to `games.local_score` and `road_score` in every E2007-E2026 game) |
| `lead_changes`, `ties` | Times the leader differs from the last leader; times the score becomes level above 0-0. Identical on both rows |
| `time_leading_seconds`, `time_trailing_seconds`, `time_tied_seconds` | Game seconds ahead, behind and level; they add up to 2,400 plus 300 per overtime |
| `largest_lead` | Biggest own margin (0 when never ahead) |
| `longest_run`, `runs_6_plus` | Largest unanswered scoring streak, and how many streaks reached 6 points |
| `clutch_seconds`, `clutch_points_for`, `clutch_points_against` | Time and points in the last five minutes of regulation and all overtime while the margin (before the event) was 5 or less |

`play_by_play.points_a` is the local team's running score and `points_b` the road team's,
present on scoring events; `None` keeps the previous value. Events are ordered as in
`game_team_possessions`. An event that changes both scores breaks every run. The time and
clutch-seconds columns are NULL for a game with a scoring event that has no usable clock
(20 club games in 10 games: 7 in E2016, 1 in E2020 and 2 in E2022 by game count); counts
and points do not depend on the clock. A game with no score in its events has no row.
Across E2007-E2026 (10,098 club games): 5.6 lead changes and 4.3 ties per game, a largest
lead of 10.8 points on average, a longest run of 9.4 points and 3.1 runs of 6 or more per
team, and 53% of club games have clutch time. `--quality-only` checks the stored rows against
a fresh derivation and warns when a final score differs from `games` (none found).

### `game_team_shot_splits`

Built by `python postgres_etl/shot_splits.py -sc <seasons>` from `games`, `shots` and
`play_by_play` (E2007 onward; same rows as `game_team_possessions`). Extra key `game_code`,
`side`. Same provenance columns. Gold copy `gold.game_team_shot_splits` (without the provenance columns) is published to Neon as `public.app_game_team_shot_splits` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30i migration is applied.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `fast_break_points`, `second_chance_points`, `points_off_turnover_points` | Points of the team's made shots (free throws included, since the feed flags them) whose `fastbreak`, `second_chance` or `points_off_turnover` flag is true; a shot with several flags counts in each |
| `field_goals_made` | Made field goal events in `play_by_play` |
| `assisted_field_goals`, `assisted_fg_pct` | Number of the team's `AS` events, capped at its made field goals, and that count over `field_goals_made` |

The three point columns are NULL for a game in which any shot has a NULL flag or which has
no shots. Flag coverage by season: none before E2015 (a few club games in E2008, E2009, E2013 and E2014
have flags), 76% of E2015 team games (382 of 500) and every game from E2016 on, so 6,510 of
the 10,098 club games have them. Assists are logged at other clock times than their shots
(sometimes much later), so pairing an assist with its shot by clock undercounted badly; the
`AS` count equals the box score's assists in 99.5% of club games (mean difference -0.003).
The average assisted share is 58% (62% in E2025). `--quality-only` checks the stored rows
against a fresh derivation and warns when assisted goals exceed made goals or a team's shot
points differ from `games` (none found).

### `game_team_shot_zones`

Built by `python postgres_etl/shot_zones.py -sc <seasons>` from `games` and `shots`
(E2007 onward). Extra key `game_code`, `side`, `zone`; columns `club_code`, `attempts`,
`made`, `points`. Gold copy `gold.game_team_shot_zones` (without the provenance columns) is published to Neon as `public.app_game_team_shot_zones` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30i migration is applied. Field goals only: `2FGM`, `3FGM`, `LAYUPMD`, `DUNK` made and `2FGA`, `3FGA`,
`LAYUPATT`, `2FGAB`, `3FGAB` missed (E2008-E2014 use the layup, dunk and blocked types; 19a
has the same list). Free throws and shots without a zone code are left out, and a team has a
row only for zones it shot from. Zone totals equal the box score's field goals made in every
game and its field goals attempted in 97-100% of games per season (a few shots have no zone).
The feed's zone codes are letters; what the data shows for each, over E2007-E2026:

| Zone | Shots | Mean court x, y | Three-pointers | Made |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 29,247 | 65, 23 | 10% | 87% |
| B | 112,559 | -85, 95 | 0% | 57% |
| C | 102,786 | 96, 95 | 0% | 56% |
| D | 50,971 | -161, 178 | 0% | 43% |
| E | 38,561 | 160, 211 | 0% | 37% |
| F | 27,226 | -346, 318 | 10% | 40% |
| G | 29,981 | 320, 385 | 20% | 38% |
| H | 108,086 | -431, 515 | 99% | 36% |
| I | 109,581 | 433, 512 | 99% | 36% |
| J | 6,427 | -286, 673 | 100% | 32% |

The codes are the feed's own; no names are assumed. The table has 87,037 rows over 5,049
games.

### `game_player_on_court`

Built by `python postgres_etl/on_court.py -sc <seasons>` from `games`, `game_player_stats` and
`play_by_play` (E2007 onward). Key `game_code`, `side`, `person_key`, `interval_ordinal`
(the player's stretches counted from 1 in time order); columns `club_code`, `start_seconds` and
`end_seconds` (elapsed game seconds). It is the base of the lineup features 29b-29d. Gold copy `gold.game_player_on_court` (without the provenance columns) is published to Neon as `public.app_game_player_on_court` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30j migration is applied.

A side starts with the players whose `started` flag is set. An `IN` adds a player, an `OUT`
removes one, in event order (period, overtime, `event_ordinal`); players carry across periods;
everyone still on the floor closes at the game end. Older seasons log period-start
substitutions at times outside the period (`11:00`, or `06:00` in overtime); these are placed
at the period start. An `IN` for a player already on court, an `OUT` for one who is not, and
events without a person code are ignored. A player's `OUT` and `IN` at the same second join
into one stretch; zero-length stretches are dropped. The play-by-play `person_code` equals the
box score's `person_key`.

The game end is 2,400 seconds plus 300 per overtime, counting overtimes from events that carry
a clock. Every game's play-by-play ends with `EG`/`EP` events with no clock and a minute one
past the last overtime; counting them added a phantom overtime to the 236 overtime games.
Feature 29a fixed this in `game_team_score_flow` too (it had added 300 seconds to the final
leader's time leading in those games) and rebuilt the season slices.

Validation against the box score, over E2007-E2026 (5,049 games, 322,528 stretches, 119,331
player-games): the summed on-court seconds differ from `seconds_played` by 7.2 seconds on
average; 85.0% of player-games are within 5 seconds, 96.9% within 60 and 99.6% within 120.
E2007-E2010 box scores have minute precision (mean difference 35-38 seconds, 79-84% within 60
seconds); E2011-E2025 have a mean difference of 0.3-4.3 seconds and 93-99.5% of player-games
within 5. 246 games (458 player-games) have a player more than 120 seconds off, 400 of those
player-games in E2007-E2010; `--quality-only` reports the player-game count per season as a
`WARN` and fails only when the stored rows differ from a fresh derivation. Hand check: E2025
game 31, player 004866 (started; out at 03:04 of the first quarter, back at 00:31 of it, and
out at 08:01 of the fourth) has stretches 0-416, 569-1462 and 1584-1919, 1,644 seconds in total,
the box score's `seconds_played`.

### `game_team_lineup_stints`

Built by `python postgres_etl/lineups.py -sc <seasons>` from `games`, `game_player_stats` and
`play_by_play` (E2007 onward), right after `game_player_on_court`. Key `game_code`, `side`,
`stint_ordinal` (counted from 1 over the stored stints of the game); two rows per stint, one
from each team's side. Gold copy `gold.game_team_lineup_stints` (without the provenance columns) is published to Neon as `public.app_game_team_lineup_stints` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30j migration is applied.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `club_code`, `opponent_club_code` | The team and its opponent |
| `start_seconds`, `end_seconds` | Elapsed game seconds; a stint runs from the substitution that formed the lineups to the next one |
| `players`, `opponent_players` | The five `person_key`s on court for the team and for the opponent, sorted and joined by commas |
| `possessions_for`, `possessions_against` | Counted possessions (19a) that ended while the lineups were on court, for the team and for the opponent |
| `points_for`, `points_against` | Points scored by the team and by the opponent in the stint (from the running score) |

A stint is a stretch with the same five players on court for both teams. The walk is the one
of `game_player_on_court`, with a stint boundary at each substitution group that changes a
lineup; lineups carry across periods. Events are attributed by event order, not by clock: a
substitution between two free throws at one clock time splits them, and the free throw made
while a team is a player short belongs to an incomplete stint. Only stints where both teams
have exactly five players are stored, and a zero-length stint with no event is dropped.
Possessions come from 19a's state machine (a counted possession belongs to the stint on court at
the event that closes it; the possession that ends a period belongs to the last stint of that
period).

Validation over E2007-E2026 (5,049 games, 346,894 rows, 34.4 stints per team-game): a team's
stint points equal its final score in 10,061 of 10,098 team-games (99.6%) and its stint
possessions equal `game_team_possessions.counted_possessions` in 10,046 (99.5%; 323 possessions
apart in total). A player's stint seconds differ from `game_player_on_court` by 0.13 seconds on
average in E2025. `--quality-only` checks the stored rows against a fresh derivation and warns
for team-games whose stints cover less than 95% of the game's minutes: 12 team-games (6 games) in
E2008, E2010, E2013, E2014 and E2017 have stored stints for less than that; every other
team-game is covered above 95%. Hand check: E2025 game 31's
first stint runs 0-226 seconds (the first substitution is at 06:14 of the first quarter) with the
five starters of each team.

### `player_on_off`

Built as `gold.player_on_off` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb player_on_off`
from `game_team_lineup_stints` (phase from `silver.games`) and `game_player_stats` (name), for
E2007 onward; a missing stint table stops the build with the command that creates it. Key
`competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope` (`all`, each phase, `PS`), `club_code`, `person_key`;
a player traded during a season has one row per club. Published to Neon as `public.app_player_on_off` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

Columns: `player_name`; `games` (games with the player on court in a stored stint); the on sums
`on_seconds`, `on_possessions_for`, `on_possessions_against`, `on_points_for`,
`on_points_against` (the club's stints with the player on court) and the same five `off_` sums (the
club's other stored stints in the scope, including games the player missed); `on_ortg`,
`on_drtg`, `on_net_rating` and the `off_` versions (points per 100 possessions; NULL without
possessions); `ortg_diff`, `drtg_diff` and `net_rating_diff` (on minus off; a positive
`drtg_diff` is a worse defense). A player who never sat has NULL off ratings and differences.
`--quality-only` checks the fresh derivation and, per club and scope, that every player's on
plus off is the same team total and the players' on-court seconds are five times the team's.
E2025: 990 rows (all scopes); 18,670 rows over E2007-E2026, 6,225 in the `all` scope.

Cross-check against the box score: a player's summed on-court point difference equals the summed
`plus_minus` of `game_player_stats` exactly in 73% of player-club-seasons of E2012-E2026 (3,297
of 4,507), within 3 points in 83%, and differs by 1.9 points on average.

### `lineup_ratings`

Built as `gold.lineup_ratings` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb lineup_ratings`
from `game_team_lineup_stints` (phase from `silver.games`) and `game_player_stats` (names), for
E2007 onward; a missing stint table stops the build with the command that creates it. Key
`competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope` (`all`, each phase, `PS`), `club_code`, `lineup_size`
(2, 3 or 5) and `lineup` (the sorted `person_key`s joined by commas). Published to Neon as `public.app_lineup_ratings` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

Every stored stint holds ten pairs, ten triples and one five of the club's players, and each group
sums the stints it was on court for. Columns: `lineup_names` (player names in lineup order joined
by `; `, the key where a name is missing); `games` (games in which the group shared the floor);
`seconds`, `possessions_for`, `possessions_against`, `points_for`, `points_against` (sums over
those stints); `ortg`, `drtg`, `net_rating` (points per 100 possessions; NULL without
possessions). Small samples are kept with their possessions; consumers filter. The 4-man groups
are not built. `--quality-only` checks the fresh derivation and, per club and scope, that the 2-man
and 3-man rows each sum to ten times the 5-man rows for every summed column.

Over E2007-E2026 the table has 107,595 pair rows, 310,996 triple rows and 195,109 five-man rows
(38,890, 121,767 and 87,544 in the `all` scope); E2025 has 6,296, 20,388 and 15,783. Hand check:
E2025's most-used five-man lineup (club HTA) has 28 games, 16,079 seconds, 483
possessions for and 596 points in the table, the same as the sums of its `game_team_lineup_stints`
rows.

### `player_rapm`

Built as `gold.player_rapm` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb player_rapm` from
`game_team_lineup_stints` (both teams' lineups per stint), `game_player_stats` (names) and the
played games of `silver.games`, for E2007 onward. It needs numpy in the Python environment
(imported only by this table; a missing numpy stops the build with a message). Key
`competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope` (always `all`: every game of the season) and
`person_key`; a traded player has one row. Published to Neon as `public.app_player_rapm` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

Method: every stint row with possessions is one observation, the team's points per 100
possessions, weighted by its counted possessions. The prediction is an intercept plus the
`offense` coefficients of the five players on offense minus the `defense` coefficients of the
five on defense, so a positive `defense` means fewer points allowed. Coefficients are ridge
penalized (the intercept is not); the penalty is chosen per season by 5-fold cross-validation over
the grid 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000 and 64000, with the folds made of whole
games, taking the strongest penalty whose error is within 0.01% of the no-player error of the
best. Small samples are not filtered: the penalty shrinks them toward zero and their possessions
are stored.

Columns: `player_name`; `seconds` (on-court seconds in stored stints); `possessions_offense` and
`possessions_defense` (counted possessions on court on each side); `penalty` (the chosen penalty,
the same on every row of a season); `offense`, `defense`, `rapm` (= offense + defense), in points
per 100 possessions relative to an average player, rounded to four decimals.

Observed over E2007-E2026 (6,164 rows; the full build takes about 25 seconds): stint outcomes
are noisy, so the best penalty improves the held-out error over a model without players by only
a few tenths of a percent (0.40% in E2015, 0.10% in E2025); the chosen penalty is 1,000-8,000
for the 19 seasons before E2026 and 64,000 for E2026 (10 games, where cross-validation shows no
improvement over the no-player model). RAPM correlates 0.87 with the on-court point margin per
100 possessions across the 3,052 player-seasons with more than 500 on-court possessions.
`--quality-only` checks the stored rows against a fresh derivation (a rerun
reproduces the rows exactly).

### `team_pbp_stats` and `team_shot_zone_stats`

Built as `gold.team_pbp_stats` and `gold.team_shot_zone_stats` by `python gold_etl/main.py
-sc <seasons> -tb team_pbp_stats team_shot_zone_stats` from `silver.games` (phase) and the
per-game tables `game_team_possessions`, `game_team_score_flow`, `game_team_shot_splits` and
`game_team_shot_zones` (E2007 onward; earlier seasons build zero rows, and a missing Silver
table stops the build with the command that creates it). Key `competition_code`,
`season_code`, `scope` (`all`, each phase, `PS`), `club_code` (and `zone` for the zone table).
Published to Neon as `public.app_team_pbp_stats` and `public.app_team_shot_zone_stats`
(E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

`team_pbp_stats` columns: `games` (games with a possessions row); from `game_team_possessions`
`counted_possessions`, `estimated_possessions`, `possession_seconds` (sums) and
`avg_possession_seconds` (per-game averages weighted by counted possessions); from
`game_team_score_flow` `lead_changes_per_game`, `ties_per_game` (means), `timed_games` and the
`time_leading_seconds`, `time_trailing_seconds`, `time_tied_seconds` sums over the games that have
time data, `largest_lead` and `longest_run` (maxima), `runs_6_plus`, `clutch_games` (timed games
with clutch time), `clutch_seconds` (timed games) and `clutch_points_for`/`clutch_points_against`
(all games); from `game_team_shot_splits` `flagged_games` (games with point splits),
`fast_break_points`, `second_chance_points`, `points_off_turnover_points` (sums over flagged
games), `field_goals_made`, `assisted_field_goals` and `assisted_fg_pct` (sum over sum). NULL means
no usable game for that column; a club can have a row with some columns NULL when a source table
has no rows for it.

`team_shot_zone_stats` columns: `attempts`, `made`, `points` (sums per zone), `fg_pct` and
`attempt_share` (the zone's attempts over the club's attempts in the scope). A club has a row only
for zones it shot from. `--quality-only` for both checks the fresh derivation and that the `all`
scope equals the sum of the phase scopes for every additive column. E2025: 66 club-scope rows and
630 zone rows.

## Standard column names

The source JSON paths have not changed. Where these stats occur, the SQL
columns use one name across v2 and v3:

| Former column | Silver column |
| --- | --- |
| `assistances` | `assists` |
| `fouls_commited` | `fouls_committed` |
| `fouls_received` | `fouls_drawn` |
| `blocks_favour` | `blocks` |
| `valuation` | `pir` |
| `field_goals_made2`, `field_goals_attempted2` | `two_pointers_made`, `two_pointers_attempted` |
| `field_goals_made3`, `field_goals_attempted3` | `three_pointers_made`, `three_pointers_attempted` |
| `field_goals_made_total`, `field_goals_attempted_total` | `field_goals_made`, `field_goals_attempted` |
| `points_scored` | `points` |
| `time_played` | `seconds_played` |
| `possesions` | `possessions` |
| `quater1_*`, `quater3_*` | `quarter1_*`, `quarter3_*` |
| `longest_wins_streak_*`, `longest_loses_streak_*` | `longest_win_streak_*`, `longest_loss_streak_*` |
| `point_difference1to5`, `6to10`, `11to15`, `_more_than15` | `point_difference_1_to_5`, `_6_to_10`, `_11_to_15`, `_more_than_15` |
| `dorsal`, `dorsal_raw` | `jersey_number`, `jersey_number_raw` |

`game_stat_gaps.stat_name` uses these silver names, or `*` for no box score.
Source zeros that mean a stat was not recorded become SQL `NULL` and are
listed there. Future fixtures remain in `games` with `played = false` and
NULL result scores. Quarter and overtime scores have separate child rows.
The source's `winner` object is the season champion;
`match_winner_club_code` is the winner of a played game. V3 percentage strings
such as `45.5%` become numeric `45.5` (percentage points).

Player and team season stats contain only API rows; the derived `PS` rows were
removed. A player stats row is one entry in a category, phase, and mode feed,
not a unique person for the season. `accumulated` and `perGame` feeds may have
different populations. The API can return stale or partial feeds; the downloader
keeps the stronger stored response and the load quality report flags missing or
partial phase/mode feeds. The same holds for round standings: an answer with fewer
clubs or games played than the stored one is kept out, and Gold `--quality-only`
warns when the five standings feeds of a round disagree on games played or won
(the API caches each feed on its own clock). Live `player_code` is the upstream ID while
`person_code` is the matched person key; join on `person_code`.

## Local Gold source tables

Feature 30a builds these 16 tables in the local `gold` schema, with the same
names, source columns, types, and natural primary keys as their Silver sources:
`seasons`, `clubs`, `people`, `registrations`, `rounds`, `games`,
`game_officials`, `game_period_scores`, `game_player_stats`, `game_team_stats`,
`season_player_stats_traditional`, `season_player_stats_advanced`,
`season_player_stats_scoring`, `season_player_stats_misc`, `play_by_play`, and
`shots`. Gold omits Silver's `load_id` and `loaded_at` metadata. It copies
source values and NULLs unchanged. The four player-season tables copy only
non-`PS` API rows; feature 30b owns derived `PS` rows in traditional and misc
Gold tables, and a source rerun leaves those rows in place. Advanced and scoring
have no derived `PS` rows. The other 12 Silver tables and `silver.load_log`
are not copied by 30a.

Nine per-game tables were added later, all named like their Silver sources and published to
Neon as `public.app_<name>` for E2025 and E2026. Seven are straight copies with the same
columns, types, NULLs and primary keys, again without `load_id` and `loaded_at`: `game_team_possessions`, `game_team_score_flow`, `game_team_shot_splits` and
`game_team_shot_zones` (30i), and `game_player_on_court`, `game_team_lineup_stints` and
`game_stat_gaps` (30j). Two are projections of Silver's per-game advanced tables with the
published column set; `game_player_advanced` also adds game PER (30h): `game_player_advanced`
and `game_team_advanced`. Each is defined in its own section below (see "Derived per-game
advanced tables" and the `game_team_*` and `game_player_on_court` sections).

`python gold_etl/main.py -sc all` builds all locally loaded Silver seasons.
`--dry-run` reports Silver source and derived row counts without Gold writes;
`--quality-only` compares Gold source and derived keys and full values with
Silver. Both read the local database only. Use
`python neon_publish/main.py -sc E2025 --dry-run` for the read-only Neon preview.
Use explicit `gold.games` or `silver.games` names because local connections
still search `silver` by default.

## Local Gold derivations and historical web-app tables

Feature 30b builds `PS` traditional and misc player-season rows from Silver
played PI/PO/FF games and box scores. One player has an accumulated row and,
when they appeared in more than half of their latest club's postseason games,
a per-game row. Missing box-score measures propagate as NULL; percentages and
per-game counting values round half-even to one decimal. No played postseason
means no `PS` rows. The local `gold.app_standings` table below is also active.
Feature 30c builds local `gold.app_team_season_stats`,
`gold.app_coverage_seasons` and `gold.app_coverage_games` from Silver. The
record and postseason series tables in this section are built locally in 30d.
Feature 30e builds the player and club identity tables locally from Silver.
The separate web app reads the Neon tables. The 30f in-place cutover changed
some table and column names; the approved
[one-time migration](../neon_publish/migrations/30f_in_place.sql) was applied
on 2026-09-28. Further live publishes require owner approval.

### `app_standings`

Built locally as `gold.app_standings` from the seven `silver.standings_*` feeds
and `silver.clubs`. It publishes as `public.app_standings` after cutover.

| Extra key | One row represents | Essential use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `phase_code`, `round_number`, `club_code` | One club in the standings of one phase and round, with every standings feed. | Filter season, phase and round; order by `group_name`, `basic_position`, `club_code`. The latest round is `max(round_number)`. |

Built from the v3 standings feeds and the season's clubs. Rows exist exactly
for the clubs in basicstandings (a quality check enforces it), so group-phase
rounds only. Verified field by field against the web app's current 7-table
standings query for all seasons (0 differences).

**Contract for the web app** (replaces the `getStandings` join and its two list
queries):

- Columns map to `StandingEntry` mechanically: feed prefix (`basic_`,
  `calendar_`, `streaks_`, `ahead_behind_`, `margins_`) plus the snake_case of
  the field name. Examples: `basic.winPercentage` -> `basic_win_percentage`,
  `aheadBehind.quarter1Ahead` -> `ahead_behind_quarter1_ahead`,
  `streaks.longestWinStreakCurrentSeason` ->
  `streaks_longest_win_streak_current_season`, `margins.pointDifference1To5`
  -> `margins_point_difference_1_to_5`.
- `clubCode`, `clubName`, `clubTvCode`, `crestUrl`, `groupName` ->
  `club_code`, `club_name`, `club_tv_code`, `crest_url`, `group_name`.
- A feed object is `null` when all of its columns are `NULL` (that feed had no
  row for the club), as with today's left joins.
- `form` (JSONB) is the `form` list and `streak_history` (JSONB) the
  `streakHistory` list, already in API shape and order; `[]` when empty. Dates
  are strings like `2025-09-01T00:00:00.000Z`.
- NUMERIC columns (`basic_win_percentage`, `ahead_behind_wins_percentage`)
  arrive as strings from node-postgres, as today.
- The web app reads the existing Neon `app_standings`. The seven former
  `app_standings_*` feed tables were retired from Neon in feature 23; their
  source snapshots now live under `silver.standings_*` locally.

### `app_records_player_seasons`, `app_records_single_games`, `app_records_team_seasons`

All-time EuroLeague leaderboards (top 50 per metric), computed in local Gold by
`gold_etl/records.py` from all loaded Silver seasons, not from bronze
files. Unlike every other table, they are **not season-scoped**: a table's
rows span every season loaded locally (`E2000`-current), so `season_code` is
a plain column (which season a record happened in), not part of the key.
Mirrors the `/records/player-seasons`, `/records/single-games` and
`/records/team-seasons` routes in the jmp-euroleague2 Express backend, same
metrics, source filters and tie-break order, so rows are self-contained
(player and club names are already on the row; no join to `app_games` or
`app_people` is needed to render one).

| Table | Key | One row represents | Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `app_records_player_seasons` | `competition_code`, `metric`, `rank_ordinal` | One player's season total, from `silver.season_player_stats_traditional` (`phase_code = 'all'`, `mode = 'accumulated'`). | `points_scored`, `total_rebounds`, `assists`, `pir` |
| `app_records_single_games` | `competition_code`, `metric`, `rank_ordinal` | One player's box score in one played game, from `silver.game_player_stats`. | `points`, `valuation`, `total_rebounds`, `assistances` |
| `app_records_team_seasons` | `competition_code`, `metric`, `rank_ordinal` | One club's season total (`stats_kind = 'total'`), summed from `silver.game_team_stats`. | `points`, `valuation`, `total_rebounds`, `assistances` |

- `rank_ordinal` is 1-50 per metric (fewer when a metric has fewer than 50
  qualifying rows); dense, no gaps or duplicates.
- Tie-break order: player-seasons and team-seasons by value desc, then
  `season_code` asc, then `person_key`/`club_code` asc; single-games by value
  desc, then `season_code` asc, `game_code` asc, `person_key` asc.
- The historical metric labels are preserved. Silver's clean `points`, `pir`
  and `assists` columns supply the `points_scored`, `valuation` and
  `assistances` labels where applicable.
- Forfeits are excluded from the two game-level tables via `silver.games.played
  = TRUE` (a forfeit has no box-score rows to rank in the first place);
  `app_records_player_seasons` reads a season-level source aggregate, so no
  separate forfeit filter applies there.
- `gold_etl/main.py` rebuilds each selected record table once from every loaded
  EuroLeague season, independent of `-sc`; `--quality-only` compares the full
  rows with a fresh Silver derivation. These tables publish by competition.
- The jmp-euroleague2 Express API still computes these records itself for
  now (`SUPPORTED_SEASONS`, currently `E2025`-`E2026` only); switching it to
  read these tables is a separate, coordinated change in that repo.

### `app_team_season_stats`

Built locally as `gold.app_team_season_stats` from played `silver.games` and
`silver.game_team_stats` `total` rows. The historical Neon table serves the
Express `/teams/:clubCode/team-stats?phase=` route; this local rebuild is not
published until the approved cutover. This table is season-scoped.

| Key | One row represents |
| --- | --- |
| `phase_code`, `club_code` | One club's totals in one phase of one season, from played games only (`stats_kind = 'total'`). |

- `club_name`, `games_played`, then `own_<measure>` and `opp_<measure>`
  (NUMERIC) for 20 historical output measures: `points`,
  `field_goals_made2/attempted2`, `field_goals_made3/attempted3`,
  `free_throws_made/attempted`, `field_goals_made_total/attempted_total`, `total_rebounds`,
  `defensive_rebounds`, `offensive_rebounds`, `assistances`, `steals`,
  `turnovers`, `blocks_favour`, `blocks_against`, `fouls_commited`,
  `fouls_received`, `valuation`.
- "Own" sums the club's own `silver.game_team_stats` row for a game; "opponent"
  sums the other side's row in the same game. Current Silver source columns use
  clean names such as `two_pointers_made`, `assists` and `pir`; Gold preserves
  the historical output names. A missing measure or opponent total makes the
  affected aggregate NULL.
- One row per phase actually present in that season's games (`RS`, `PI`,
  `PO`, `FF`, or older `TS`) — no synthetic "all phases" row; Express has
  none either.

### `app_coverage_seasons` and `app_coverage_games`

Built locally as `gold.app_coverage_seasons` and `gold.app_coverage_games` from
Silver. The historical Neon tables serve the Express `/coverage` route (with
and without `?gameCode=`); the local rebuild publishes through the 30f cutover. Both are
season-scoped. `app_coverage_seasons` has
one row per season; `app_coverage_games` has one row per game (played or
not).

| Table | Key | One row represents |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app_coverage_seasons` | (season only) | 8 data-coverage items for one season. |
| `app_coverage_games` | `game_code` | The same 8 items, scoped to one game. |

Both store their items as one `items JSONB NOT NULL` column: an array of
exactly 8 objects, always in this order, each shaped
`{key, label, status, availableCount, applicableCount}`:

| # | `key` | `availableCount` / `applicableCount` (season row) | Status rule |
| - | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `boxScores` | games with a `silver.game_team_stats` `total` row / played games | gameStatus |
| 2 | `periodScores` | games with a `silver.game_period_scores` row / played games | gameStatus |
| 3 | `officialStandings` | distinct clubs in `silver.standings_basic` / distinct clubs in `silver.clubs` | rosterStatus |
| 4 | `rosters` | distinct clubs with a row in `silver.registrations` / distinct clubs in `silver.clubs` | rosterStatus |
| 5 | `playerPhotos` | distinct `person_key` with a headshot in `silver.game_player_stats` among played games / played games | gameStatus |
| 6 | `seasonStatistics` | distinct `person_key` in `silver.season_player_stats_traditional` / distinct clubs in `silver.clubs` | rosterStatus |
| 7 | `shotLocations` | games with a `silver.shots` row / played games | gameStatus |
| 8 | `playByPlay` | games with a `silver.play_by_play` row / played games | gameStatus |

Items 5 and 6 compare a player count against a game/club count — an existing
Express quirk, replicated as-is, not a design choice made here.

- **gameStatus**(available, applicable): `applicable = 0` →
  `notYetApplicable`; `available = 0` → `unavailable`; `available >=
  applicable` → `available`; otherwise `partial`.
- **rosterStatus**: same as gameStatus, but `incomplete` instead of `partial`.
- `app_coverage_games` scoping: items 1, 2, 5, 7, 8 narrow every count to that
  one game (`applicableCount` becomes 0 or 1, per whether the game is
  played); items 3, 4, 6 stay season-wide, identical to that season's
  `app_coverage_seasons` row. This mismatched scoping is Express's existing
  behavior, replicated exactly.
- **Approved change from Express:** `shotLocations` and `playByPlay` are
  computed from this pipeline's own `silver.shots`/`silver.play_by_play` data. Before
  Express read these tables, it hardcoded both as `unavailable`.

### `app_postseason_series`

Built locally as `gold.app_postseason_series` from `silver.games`, one selected
competition and season at a time. Read-only quality checks compare all fields
and the ordered game list with a fresh Silver derivation. Neon continues serving
its existing table until 30f.

One row per club pairing per phase per season, for `phase_code IN ('PI',
'PO', 'FF')` only (play-in, playoffs, Final Four — not the `TS` "Top 16"
round-robin group stage, which isn't postseason). No existing Express
contract exists for this table; unlike the tables above, it's a new design,
deliberately conservative: it reports only facts already in `app_games` and
invents no bracket-position labels ("Quarterfinal 1", seed numbers, etc.)
that the source data doesn't carry.

| Key | One row represents |
| --- | --- |
| `phase_code`, `club_a_code`, `club_b_code` | Every game two clubs played against each other in one phase of one season. `club_a_code < club_b_code` alphabetically, so the same pairing never produces two rows regardless of which club was local/road in a given game. |

- `club_a_name`, `club_b_name`, `games_played` (count of games between the
  pair, played or not), `club_a_wins`, `club_b_wins` (counted only from
  `played = TRUE` games), `winner_club_code` (the club with strictly more
  wins; `NULL` while tied, including a series still in progress).
- `games` (JSONB NOT NULL): array ordered by `round_number`, one entry per
  game between the pair: `{gameCode, roundNumber, scheduledAt,
  localClubCode, roadClubCode, localScore, roadScore, winnerClubCode}`.
  `localScore`, `roadScore`, `winnerClubCode` are `null` for a not-yet-played
  game.
- One definition covers every era without hardcoding a format: today's `PO`
  is a best-of-5 quarterfinal (confirmed against E2025: 2 home games, 2
  away, a deciding 5th only when tied 2-2); older seasons show different
  game counts per pairing (for example best-of-3), and the row just reports
  however many games were actually played. `FF` semifinals/final and `PI`
  pairings don't repeat within a season, so each naturally becomes its own
  1-game row (confirmed against E2025: three distinct `PI` pairings, not one
  pair playing twice; a 3-game `FF` with no third-place game that year).
- No "series is decided" status field: whether a series is finished isn't
  reliably derivable without hardcoding a best-of-N target per era, so it's
  intentionally not stored. `winner_club_code` plus the game list already
  show the state.

### `app_players`

Built locally as `gold.app_players` from player registrations and people in
every loaded Silver season. The Gold CLI's `-sc` selection does not limit this
cross-season table. It is rebuilt for the selected competition in one
transaction. Neon publishing replaces each identity table's competition scope.

One row per player (`person_code`), like the records tables above (not
season-scoped: a player's row spans every season they appeared in). No
existing Express contract exists for this table. The build-plan line named
three uses — careers, archives, head-to-head — but only "identity lookup"
needed a new table: archives (season-by-season club history) is already
fully in `app_registrations`, and head-to-head (shared games) is already
fully in `app_game_player_stats`, both joinable by `person_code` (confirmed
identical to `person_key` for every player in local history). Career stat
totals are deliberately not precomputed here either — `app_season_stats_traditional`
already has the per-season numbers, summable by `person_code` like any other
cross-season query.

| Key | One row represents |
| --- | --- |
| `(competition_code, person_code)` | One player who has at least one `role_code = 'J'` row in `silver.registrations` (excludes coaches, staff, and referee-only people). |

- `name`, `country_code`, `country_name`, `height_cm`, `weight_kg`,
  `birth_at`, `birth_country_code`, `birth_country_name`, `position`,
  `position_name`: "latest known" — taken from the row with the maximum
  `season_code` for that player, since these can change slightly season to
  season and the app needs one current-best answer.
- `first_season_code`, `last_season_code`, `seasons_played` (INTEGER NOT
  NULL): the player's career span, from every `role_code = 'J'`
  registration.
- `clubs` (JSONB NOT NULL): array of `{seasonCode, clubCode, clubName}`,
  ordered by season, one entry per distinct season+club the player was
  registered to as a player — the compact archive summary; full per-season
  detail (dorsal, position that season, exact dates) stays in
  `app_registrations`.

### `app_club_identities`

Built locally as `gold.app_club_identities` from every loaded `silver.clubs`
season. One row per `(competition_code, club_code)`; a name change does not
create another identity. `name`, `crest_url`, `country_code`, and `country_name`
come from the latest loaded season for that club code. Missing source values
stay NULL. `first_season_code`, `last_season_code`, and `seasons_played INTEGER
NOT NULL` describe the club's distinct loaded seasons. The table does not store
a season-by-season profile history. The Gold CLI rebuilds the selected
competition in one transaction even when `-sc` names one season. Neon
publishing replaces this table's competition scope after the approved cutover.

#### Club code and TV code in the web API

`club_code` is a club's permanent ID across every season. `club_tv_code`
(`app_standings`) is the code the club goes by on TV in one season, and it
follows sponsors and renames, so the same club can have a different TV code in
another season (for example `ULK` is the club code of a club whose TV code was
`FBB` in 2025). The web API (feature 32a) returns the TV code for the requested
season on every club it names: `tvCode` on a club object (games, teams,
postseason series, a player's registrations) and `clubTvCode` on a flat row that
carries `clubCode` and `clubName` (advanced standings and leaders, the players
list and a player's page, the form leaders, single-game and team-season
records). Its value is the most recent non-empty `club_tv_code` the season's
`app_standings` hold for the club (regular-season rows first, then the highest
round); a club the standings do not code gets its abbreviated name, and failing
that its club code. A game side that is still to be set is `null`. Standings
entries keep their own nullable `clubTvCode`, and the season statistics keep
`clubTvCodes`; player-season records pass the latter through.

### `team_round_stats`

Built as `gold.team_round_stats` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
team_round_stats` from `silver.games`, `silver.game_team_stats` (`total` rows)
and `silver.game_team_advanced`. Published to Neon as `public.app_team_round_stats` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

Key: `competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope`, `round_number`, `club_code`.
`scope` is `all` (every phase), a phase code (`RS`, `PI`, `PO`, `FF`, `TS`, ...)
or `PS` (`PI`+`PO`+`FF`). `round_number` is the round stored in `silver.games`,
continuous across phases within a season. A club has a row for every round of
the scope from its first counted game on; a round it did not play carries its
previous cumulative values forward (eliminated clubs keep their final values).

Counted games are played games with a full box score for both sides.
Forfeits (`game_stat_gaps` `*`, for example E2001 game 264 and E2003 game 200)
are not counted, so `games_played` can be one lower than the API's.

| Columns | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `games_played`, `wins`, `losses`, `points_for`, `points_against` | Cumulative record and points through the round |
| `own_*`, `opp_*` (`field_goals_made`, `field_goals_attempted`, `three_pointers_made`, `free_throws_made`, `free_throws_attempted`, `offensive_rebounds`, `defensive_rebounds`, `turnovers`, `assists`) | Cumulative club and opponent totals |
| `game_minutes`, `possessions` | Sums of the per-game `game_team_advanced` values |
| `mov` | (`points_for` - `points_against`) / `games_played` |
| `pythagorean_win_pct`, `pythagorean_wins`, `pythagorean_exponent` | `PF^e / (PF^e + PA^e)`, times games; `e` = 10.25, stored on every row |
| `pace`, `offensive_rating`, `defensive_rating`, `net_rating` | Feature 25's formulas on cumulative totals |
| `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `drb_pct`, `ft_rate`, `true_shooting_pct`, `assist_ratio`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_tov_pct`, `opp_ft_rate` | Feature 25's formulas on cumulative totals (fractions, not per-game averages) |

NULL means an input was missing or a denominator was zero; one missing game
value makes the later cumulative values NULL.

API cross-check (`--quality-only`, warnings only). The API's accumulated team
feeds (`season_team_stats_traditional`, `_advanced`) are compared with each
scope's final round: `games_played` and the counting totals must match exactly,
and `efg_pct`, `true_shooting_pct`, `orb_pct`, `drb_pct` must agree within 0.06
percentage points (the API rounds to one decimal). The API's `all` scope is
every phase, like ours. `PS` has no API feed and is skipped. The API's
`turnovers_ratio`, `assists_ratio` and `free_throws_rate` use different
definitions and are not compared. Across E2000-E2026 the only differences are
the two forfeits above (`games_played` off by one for the forfeit's club in the
`all` and `TS` scopes).

### `team_round_ratings`

Built as `gold.team_round_ratings` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
team_round_ratings` from the same Silver inputs and counted games as
`team_round_stats`, with the same key (`competition_code`, `season_code`,
`scope`, `round_number`, `club_code`) and the same rows. Published to Neon as `public.app_team_round_ratings` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.
All values are cumulative through the round within the scope.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `league_offensive_rating`, `league_pace` | `100 x points / possessions` and `40 x possessions / minutes` over every counted game in the scope, each game counted once per side |
| `relative_offensive_rating`, `relative_defensive_rating`, `relative_pace` | The club's cumulative value minus the league value (relative net rating equals `net_rating`, so it is not stored) |
| `connected` | True when every club in the scope-round can reach every other through played games |
| `srs` | Simple Rating System: solves `r_i = MOV_i + mean of opponents' r`, mean 0, from per-game margins (no home-court or margin cap) |
| `sos`, `sov` | Mean opponent `srs` over all games (`srs - mov`) and over games won (NULL without wins) |
| `adj_net_rating`, `adj_offensive_rating`, `adj_defensive_rating` | Possession-weighted, opponent-adjusted ratings per 100 possessions. The possession-weighted league mean of the offensive and defensive ratings is the league rating and of the net rating is 0 |

`srs`, `sos`, `sov` and the adjusted ratings are NULL when `connected` is false
(for example the playoff-only scopes `PI`, `PO`, and often `FF`/`PS`, whose series
form separate pairs, and RS rounds 1-2 before schedules link up). The adjusted
offensive and defensive ratings are also NULL when the game graph is bipartite
(RS rounds 1-2), because offense and defense cannot be separated; the adjusted
net rating is still defined. `--quality-only` re-derives the table, compares it,
and reports an error if a connected scope-round's `srs` sum or possession-weighted
`adj_net_rating` mean is not zero.

### `team_round_splits`

Built as `gold.team_round_splits` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
team_round_splits` from the same Silver inputs and counted games as
`team_round_stats`, with the same key (`competition_code`, `season_code`,
`scope`, `round_number`, `club_code`) and the same rows. Published to Neon as `public.app_team_round_splits` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

Four groups of columns, each with the same measures, all through the round
within the scope:

| Group | Games included |
| --- | --- |
| `home_*` | The club was the `local` side in `silver.games` |
| `away_*` | The club was the `road` side |
| `last5_*`, `last10_*` | The club's most recent 5 and 10 counted games in the scope, ordered by `round_number` then `game_code` (fewer early in a scope) |

Per group `g`: `g_games`, `g_wins`, `g_mov` (points for minus against per game),
`g_offensive_rating`, `g_defensive_rating`, `g_net_rating` (per 100 possessions)
and `g_pace` (per 40 minutes), using `game_team_advanced` possessions and
minutes. A group with no games has zero counts and NULL rates; a missing input
makes that group's rates NULL. Neutral-site games (for example the Final Four)
keep the source's local/road designation. `--quality-only` re-derives the table,
compares it, and errors if home plus away games or wins differ from
`team_round_stats`, if a window's game count is not `min(N, games_played)`, or if
a window's MOV differs from the cumulative MOV while the club has no more games
than the window.

### `player_round_stats`

Built as `gold.player_round_stats` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
player_round_stats` from `silver.game_player_stats`, `game_player_advanced` and the
counted team games of `team_round_stats`. Published to Neon as `public.app_player_round_stats` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

Key: `competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope`, `round_number`, `person_key`
(`scope` as in `team_round_stats`). A player has a row for every scope round from
their first appearance on; idle rounds carry the previous values. `club_code` and
`player_name` come from the latest appearance, so a player who changes club keeps
one row and blended rates. An appearance is a counted game with `seconds_played` > 0
(DNP rows are not counted); `games_played` and `games_started` count appearances.

| Columns | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `seconds_played`, `points`, `field_goals_*`, `three_pointers_*`, `free_throws_*`, `offensive_rebounds`, `defensive_rebounds`, `total_rebounds`, `assists`, `steals`, `turnovers`, `blocks`, `fouls_committed`, `pir` | Cumulative totals |
| `ts_pct`, `efg_pct` | `PTS / (2 (FGA + 0.44 FTA))`, `(FGM + 0.5 3PM) / FGA` |
| `usg_pct`, `ast_pct`, `orb_pct`, `drb_pct`, `trb_pct`, `stl_pct`, `blk_pct`, `tov_pct` | Standard forms as ratios of sums over the player's games, each game with its own team and opponent; `s/T` is the share of the game the player was on court (`seconds / (game_minutes x 60)`) |
| `possessions_played`, `*_per_100` | Estimated player possessions (sum of `s/T x game possessions`) and points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers per 100 of them |
| `game_score_total`, `game_score_average` | Sum and mean of `game_player_advanced.game_score` |
| `pie` | Player numerator over the numerator of both teams in the same games (`PTS + FGM + FTM - FGA - FTA + DREB + OREB/2 + AST + STL + BLK/2 - PF - TOV`) |

Rates are fractions; NULL means an input was missing or a denominator was zero.
API cross-check (`--quality-only`, warnings only), against the accumulated
`season_player_stats_traditional` and `_advanced` feeds for each scope's final
round (`PS` has no feed): games, counting totals and `pir` must match exactly and
minutes within 0.01 (they do for all 23,274 comparable rows in E2000-E2026);
for players with at least 100 minutes, `efg_pct` and `ts_pct` must agree within
0.06 percentage points and the rebound rates within 2 points (the API's team-minute
conventions differ a little). The API's `turnovers_ratio`, `assists_ratio` and
`possessions` use other definitions and are not compared. The only differences across
E2000-E2026 are two `efg_pct` warnings (E2007, a 0.7-point gap for 2 players).

Note: until the `silver-player-minutes-share` fix, `silver.game_player_advanced`
computed `usage_pct`, `assist_pct` and the rebound, steal and block rates with a
minutes share 5x too small. The stored rows were rebuilt with the corrected share
(seconds over game seconds); `player_round_stats` never used those columns.

### `player_round_ratings`

Built as `gold.player_round_ratings` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
player_round_ratings` from `silver.game_player_stats` and the same counted games as
`team_round_stats`. Key `competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope` (`all`, each phase,
`PS`), `round_number`, `person_key`; same row set as `player_round_stats`. Published to Neon as `public.app_player_round_ratings` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `club_code`, `player_name`, `games_played`, `seconds_played` | Latest club and name, appearances and cumulative seconds through the round |
| `uper` | Hollinger's unadjusted PER per minute from cumulative totals, league constants (factor, VOP, DRB%) summed over every counted game of the scope through the round, and the player's team assist ratio |
| `aper` | `uper` x league pace / the player's team pace (over the games the player appeared in) |
| `per` | `aper` x 15 / the seconds-weighted mean `aper` of the scope's players through the round, so the league mean is 15 |

The team context comes from the games the player played (each with that game's own
club), not the club's full-season totals as Basketball-Reference uses, so values differ
slightly for players who missed games. There is no minutes cutoff: values for players
with a few minutes are noisy and can be negative. NULL means an input was missing or a
denominator was zero. The API player feeds have no PER, so the only checks are the fresh
derivation equality and the league-mean invariant in `--quality-only`.

### `player_round_win_shares`

Built as `gold.player_round_win_shares` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
player_round_win_shares` from `silver.game_player_stats` and the same counted games as
`team_round_stats`. Key `competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope` (`all`, each phase,
`PS`), `round_number`, `person_key`; same row set as `player_round_stats`. Published to Neon as `public.app_player_round_win_shares` (E2025 and E2026) once the reviewed 30g migration is applied.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `club_code`, `player_name`, `games_played`, `seconds_played` | Latest club and name, appearances and cumulative seconds through the round |
| `off_win_shares` | (Points produced - 0.92 x league points per possession x individual possessions) / marginal points per win, Basketball-Reference's method |
| `def_win_shares` | Minutes share x team possessions x (1.08 x league points per possession - individual defensive rating / 100) / marginal points per win; the defensive rating uses stops and the stop percentage |
| `win_shares`, `win_shares_per_40` | `off_win_shares + def_win_shares`, and `win_shares` x 40 / minutes played (a EuroLeague game is 40 minutes; the league mean is about 0.100) |

Marginal points per win = 0.32 x league points per team game x (the player's team pace
over the games the player played / league pace). Player, club and opponent totals are
summed over the games the player played (each game with its own club), league values over
every counted game of the scope through the round, so values differ slightly from
Basketball-Reference for players who missed games. A bracketed ratio whose count is zero
(free throw percentage with no attempts, no field goal attempts, no team free throws) counts
as 0; any other zero denominator or a missing input gives NULL. Early rounds are noisy and
values can be negative. There is no API Win Shares figure. `--quality-only` checks the
fresh derivation equality and prints `WARN` when a scope round with at least 30 games has
total Win Shares more than 15% away from its game count (each game has one win). Across
E2000-E2026 those totals are 0.90-1.07 of the games, mostly 1.03, so no warning is printed.

### `app_standings_stats`

Built as `gold.app_standings_stats` by `python gold_etl/main.py -sc <seasons> -tb
app_standings_stats`: one wide, page-shaped row per club, scope and round, a projection of
`team_round_stats`, `team_round_ratings` and `team_round_splits` (same row set; values
identical, nothing recomputed). Key `competition_code`, `season_code`, `scope`, `round_number`,
`club_code`. For a group phase, `scope = phase_code` joins it to `app_standings` on
(`season_code`, `phase_code`, `round_number`, `club_code`); `scope` also takes `all` and `PS`.
It is registered with the round tables and is in the Neon allowlist since 30g
(`public.app_standings_stats`, E2025 and E2026, once the migration is applied). Both it and
`app_team_season_stats` are kept.

| Columns | Source |
|---|---|
| `club_name`, `games_played`, `wins`, `losses`, `points_for`, `points_against`, `possessions`, `mov`, `pythagorean_win_pct`, `pythagorean_wins`, `pace`, `offensive_rating`, `defensive_rating`, `net_rating`, `efg_pct`, `tov_pct`, `orb_pct`, `drb_pct`, `ft_rate`, `opp_efg_pct`, `opp_tov_pct`, `opp_ft_rate`, `true_shooting_pct`, `assist_ratio` | `team_round_stats` (raw own/opponent totals, `game_minutes` and `pythagorean_exponent` are left out) |
| `connected`, `league_offensive_rating`, `league_pace`, `relative_*`, `srs`, `sos`, `sov`, `adj_*` | `team_round_ratings` |
| `home_*`, `away_*`, `last5_*`, `last10_*` (`games`, `wins`, `mov`, `offensive_rating`, `defensive_rating`, `net_rating`, `pace`) | `team_round_splits` |

`--quality-only` checks the fresh derivation and that every stored row equals the stored
source rows. Comparison with `app_standings` (E2000-E2026, all 12,345 group-phase rows have a
match): `games_played` differs in 191 rows (1.5%), `wins` in 135 and `points_for` in 2,858
(23%, an average gap of about 5-15 points a row). The largest gap is E2021's regular season
(for example round 12, where `app_standings` lists 21-23 games per club and this table 12), so
the standings feed's round numbering differs from the game round there; the cause was not
investigated. The remaining `games_played` and `wins` differences are in a few rounds of
E2001 and E2003 (top sixteen), E2012, E2020 and E2022. No gate is applied.

## Source responses

The complete API responses are the bronze files under `data/bronze/` (see
`README.md`), not a database table. `etl_source_payloads`, a copy of them in
PostgreSQL, was dropped in feature 23.

## Common query patterns

The local connection searches `silver` by default. Explicit schema names also work:

```sql
SELECT game_code, scheduled_at, local_score, road_score
FROM silver.games
WHERE competition_code = 'E' AND season_code = 'E2025' AND played IS TRUE;

SELECT person_key, player_name, club_code, games_played, points
FROM silver.season_player_stats_traditional
WHERE competition_code = 'E' AND season_code = 'E2025'
  AND phase_code = 'RS' AND mode = 'accumulated';

SELECT club_code, club_name, position, games_played
FROM silver.standings_basic
WHERE competition_code = 'E' AND season_code = 'E2025'
  AND phase_code = 'RS' AND round_number = 38;
```

## Post-load checks

Normal flat-table loads now run read-only quality checks after loading each
selected season. To check an already-loaded season without changing data:

```powershell
python postgres_etl/main.py -sc 2025 --quality-only
python postgres_etl/main.py -sc 2025 -tb games game_player_stats --quality-only
```

The checks count loaded rows, flag empty selected tables, verify played and
unplayed game result rules, and check game, club, and person references when
both participating tables were selected. Database primary keys already
prevent duplicate keys. A partial-table load is checked only against its
selected tables. Checks do **not** certify upstream completeness, historical
live-feed availability, or every metric's sports meaning. Use
`--skip-quality-check` only when intentionally bypassing the automatic
post-load pass. Tests for this behavior live in `postgres_etl/tests/`.
